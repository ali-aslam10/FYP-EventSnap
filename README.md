# FYP-EventSnap
The EventSnap project aims to streamline event photo management through a subscription based platform leveraging advanced technologies. Event organizers can create and manage 
events, upload event photos, and gain insights through user engagement analytics. Attendees 
can retrieve their photos effortlessly using AI-driven image recognition by uploading a 
reference image and entering the event ID. An NLP-powered chatbot enhances user 
interaction, providing seamless navigation and support. The system integrates secure 
payment gateways like JazzCash and Stripe to handle organizer subscriptions while 
maintaining compliance with PCI-DSS standards.
